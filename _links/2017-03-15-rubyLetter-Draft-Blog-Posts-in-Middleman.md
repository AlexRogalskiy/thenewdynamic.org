The RubyLetter site — the one you’re reading right now — is built using the static site generator, Middleman. I really like Middleman because it feels much more fully-featured that Jekyll. However one thing that I missed from Jekyll was the drafts folder. You can put draft blog posts in _drafts and you’ll see them in development but not in production.
