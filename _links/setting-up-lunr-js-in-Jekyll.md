lunrjs is a client side search system that is perfectly suited for Jekyll and other static site systems. 

Setting it up in Jekyll without any plugins (so it works on Github Pages) isnâ€™t that hard only needs a couple of extra files and some Javascript. You can see the commit used to add lunr to this site here.
