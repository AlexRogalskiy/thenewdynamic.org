I’ve been primarily using Windows as my operating system for the past year or so. Having used Linux for a long time, I definitely missed the conveniences offered by shell scripting and other command line tools. However, while setting up a workflow in Windows for publishing content to my website I discovered that Windows’ scripting tools are not all that bad. In fact, for anyone familiar with scripting from Linux, moving to Powershell isn’t that hard.
