 The layout string used by the Parse function and Format method shows by example how the reference time should be represented. We stress that one must show how the reference time is formatted, not a time of the user's choosing. Thus each layout string is a representation of the time stamp, Jan 2 15:04:05 2006 MST An easy way to remember this value is that it holds, when presented in this order, the values (lined up with the elements above): 1 2  3  4  5    6  -7
