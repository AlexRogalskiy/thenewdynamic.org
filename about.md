I've built hundreds of websites over the past dozen years from super simple to the complex. As a long-time user and observer of web publishing technology, and you could say at times a partisan in the CMS wars, I've never been as excited as I am about static site generators and the "Post-CMS world". Why?

#### Details of the site. 

This site is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with my own [theme](https://github.com/budparr/jekyll-on-the-rocks) coded by hand in Sublime Text and is published to an [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/) S3 bucket, using [@laurilehmijoki's](https://github.com/laurilehmijoki) excellent [S3_website gem](https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website) and [Travis Continuous Integration](https://travis-ci.org/) Service to push my builds from Github to S3.
