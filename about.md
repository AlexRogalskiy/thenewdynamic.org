The purpose of this site is to promote the use of static site generators for people who build websites. I hope to fill the site out and as it grows add functionality to to make it easy to find resources and information related to the top static site generators.

The site will be editorially driven; that is, it will not attempt to be comprehensive, just, hopefully, interesting.

Soon, I will make the tags live links and add search and other functionality.

#### Details of the site.

This site is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with my own [theme](https://github.com/budparr/jekyll-on-the-rocks) coded by hand in Sublime Text and is published to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

I have a branch of this site published to an [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/) S3 bucket, using [@laurilehmijoki's](https://github.com/laurilehmijoki) excellent [S3_website gem](https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website) and [Travis Continuous Integration](https://travis-ci.org/) Service to push my builds from Github to S3. Here are some tutorials:
