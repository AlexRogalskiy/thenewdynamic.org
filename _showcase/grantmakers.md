> My intention with [Grantmakers.io](https://www.grantmakers.io/) is to simply
demonstrate a new way of thinking about philanthropic data accessibility. The
Grantmakers.io dataset along with every line of code is open source and freely
available on Github for a reason. I hope the code starts a dialogue between
philanthropy insiders and geeks like me, and I look forward to seeing where the
community takes it â€” <cite><a
