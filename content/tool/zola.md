Gutenberg comes as a single executable with Sass compilation, syntax highlighting, table of contents and many other features that traditionally require setting up a dev environment or adding some JavaScript libraries to your site. The average site will be generated in less than a second, including Sass compilation and syntax highlighting thanks toÂ [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
