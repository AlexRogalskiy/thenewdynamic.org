BitBalloon was the ancestor from [Netlify](/tool/netlify/), it's a simpler version aimed at people who just need to drag and drop a static project to get it online[.](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2018/08/14/announcing-netlify-drop---the-simplicity-of-bitballoon-with-the-added-power-of-netlify/)

[Bitballoon is now **Netlify Drop**](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2018/08/14/announcing-netlify-drop---the-simplicity-of-bitballoon-with-the-added-power-of-netlify/)
