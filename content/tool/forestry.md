Forestry is an elegant visual content manager for static sites, that will commit changes to your Git repository.

* Currently you can import Hugo, Jekyll and VuePress sites.   
  Gatsby support is still in beta.
* Page templates and [front matter templates](https://forestry.io/docs/settings/front-matter-templates/) ease creating and editing documents for non-technical users, who can drag-and-drop blocks to build pages.

![Front Matter template creation](https://res.cloudinary.com/forestry-demo/image/fetch/c_limit,dpr_auto,f_auto,q_80,w_674/https://forestry.io/uploads/2018/01/35.png "Front Matter template creation in Forestry")

* Contributors can preview their work before saving and publishing.
* Forestry supports third party media storage ([Cloudinary](https://forestry.io/docs/media/cloudinary/) and [S3](https://forestry.io/docs/media/s3/) for now).
