We want Grow to be the canonical way for teams and individuals to build, launch, and maintain high-quality, content-rich web sites. It's architected to work for humans, to allow people pair it with their own development tools, to run locally and in the cloud, and to bring simplicity to web site management.

Grow (the app) and the stuff you make with it (your sites) are portable. You can run Grow anywhere, and you can take your content anywhere because your content is stored as flat files. There will never be lock-in with Grow.
