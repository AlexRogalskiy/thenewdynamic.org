Vssue is a **Vue** component / plugin, which can enable comments for your static pages.

As your pages are "static", you don't have database nor backend APIs, but you still want users to login and post comments. With the help of OAuth API of the code hosting platforms (e.g. Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, Coding, etc.), Vssue can help users to login with account of those platforms, store the comments in their **Issue** System, and display the comments on current page.

This is how **Vssue** get its name : **Vue**-powered and **Issue**-based.
