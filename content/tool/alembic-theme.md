Alembic is a starting point for Jekyll projects. Rather than starting from scratch, this boilerplate is designed to get the ball rolling immediately. Install it, configure it, tweak it, push it.

Features include:

* Extensive set of shortcodes to include various elements; such as buttons, icons, figure images and more
* Solid typographic framework from Sassline
* Configurable navigation via a single file
* Modular Jekyll components
* Easily interchangeable sidebar
* Contact form built in using Formspree
* Works on GitHub Pages out of the box
* Designed with Siteleaf in mind
