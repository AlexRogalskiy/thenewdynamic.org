Front-end developers have significantly more power and autonomy to create full-featured apps as the back-end is being moved more and more into services. In this course, you'll learn how the different parts of the JAMstack fit together, from building apps out of only static assets to handling asynchronous interactions with serverless functions. You'll also set up advanced features like authentication and store and retrieve information from databases, then ship your new site to production!
