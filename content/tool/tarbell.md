description: Tarbell makes use of familiar, flexible tools to take the magic (and
  frustration) out of publishing to the web. Google spreadsheets handle content management,
  so changes to your stories are easy to make without touching a line of code.

Tarbell is an open source publishing tool that emphasizes simplicity, fundamental skills, and low maintenance for published projects. Tarbell has been used for dozens of projects at the Chicago Tribune, Al Jazeera America, The University of Nebraska, Frontline, and more.

Tarbell combines Google spreadsheets for data management with powerful project creation, templating, and publishing tools. Most of the projects on this site were built with Tarbell, including the portfolio itself.
