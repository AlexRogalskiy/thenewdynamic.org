Spike is a next-generation static site generator. It is built on top of [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), and a foundation of [html](http://reshape.ml/), [css](http://postcss.org/), and [js](http://babeljs.io/) parsers that accept plugins to transform the output. Itâ€™s fast, actively developed, and very data-friendly.
