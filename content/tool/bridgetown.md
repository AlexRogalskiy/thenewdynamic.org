Built upon proven open source technology,**Bridgetown**is a*fast*,*scalable*,*modular*, and*thoroughly forward-looking*framework for building websites and frontend applications.

* **Craft Clever Content.**Content in Bridgetown is simply text files and assets in your repository. Write flexible**Markdown**and use sophisticated**Liquid**tags to enhance your presentation and functionality. Using a headless CMS or third-party APIs? That works too!
* **Design with Components.**Encapsulate common building-blocks of your design which can be reused across multiple pages and contexts or displayed in an always up-to-date style guide. Use components provided by[themes and plugins](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/plugins/)or write your own.
* **Customize with Plugins.**Develop your own plugins in the delightful Ruby programming language to enable totally custom projects, or[install community gems](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/plugins/)to supercharge your site build. Sprinkle Ruby Front Matter on templates to bring them to life.
* **Add a Modern Frontend.**Bridgetown comes with support for**Webpack**out-of-the-box, which means you can add Javascript frameworks like**React**,**Vue**,**Stimulus**as well as CSS frameworks like**Bulma**or**Tailwind**to get a leg up fast.
* **Deploy Anywhere.**Use an automated hosting service like[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)to deploy your site upon every update, or just sync the`output`folder to a standard web server and you’re done. It’s without a doubt the most flexible publishing system available.
