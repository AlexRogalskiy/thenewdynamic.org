Firebase Hosting is built for the modern web developer. Static sites are more powerful than ever with the rise of front-end JavaScript frameworks like Angular and static generator tools like Jekyll. Whether you are deploying a simple app landing page or a complex Progressive Web App, Hosting gives you the infrastructure, features, and tooling tailored to deploying and managing static websites.
