Tina is a **lightweight but powerful toolkit** for creating a content editing interface with JavaScript components. Tina surfaces superpowers for developers to create an intuitive UI for real-time content editing, built directly into their website.

## The Next Generation of Content Management

![tina-gif](https://res.cloudinary.com/forestry-demo/video/upload/du_16,w_700,e_loop/v1571159974/tina-hero-demo.gif)Tina is optimized for next-gen JAMstack tools. It is written in JavaScript and easily adapted to multiple different frameworks.

Tina currently supports React-based frameworks, including:

* Create-React-App
* Gatsby
* NextJS

Plans to support Vue.js, NuxtJS, Gridsome and write to third party API based services (Contentful, WordPress, Airtable, etc.)
