TinaCMS surfaces superpowers for JS developers to build a CMS UI to provide real-time content editing, on top of your website without any performance impact.

![Sidebar editing with TinaCMS](https://tina.io/img/edit-alongside-content.gif)

Tina is written in JavaScript, mainly React for now, but is designed to be adapted to other frameworks like Vue or Svelte.
Next.js is currently the default recommended framework.
