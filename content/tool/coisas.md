Coisas is a headless CMS specifically designed to let you edit files hosted in a GitHub repository. It is similar to Netlify CMS and Prose. Unlike existing alternatives, coisas doesn't try to be a multipurpose CMS. It still lets you edit, create, upload, and browse files, but doesn't try to look like a fancy CMS (custom schema, objects and all that mess). It also isn't tailored to Jekyll websites, which means that it won't insert Jekyll specific code or expect your repository to have a Jekyll-specific file structure.
