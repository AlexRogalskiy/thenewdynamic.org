description: "imgix solves the context problem by making all of your images responsive and enabling on-the-fly manipulation, while improving delivery speed."
---
Delivering the optimal version of an image for a given context has a dramatic impact on how fast your website or application loads and therefore how your users perceive you. imgix gives you the power and flexibility of responsive images without having to build the complex infrastructure required to support them. Similarly, it provides powerful image manipulation capabilities without the need to pre-render or create multiple versions of an image.

Simply configure where your images live, and access them at the domain we provide.
