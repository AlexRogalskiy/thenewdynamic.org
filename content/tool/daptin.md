**Daptin is an open-source backend development framework** to develop and deploy production-ready JSONAPI microservices. With Daptin you can design your data model and have a production ready JSON API online in minutes.

By following shared conventions, you can increase productivity, take advantage of generalized tooling, and focus on what matters: your application.

The framework integrates with cloud servers and is compatible with existing libraries and tools like JSONAPI.org/implementations and OAuth2. Daptin comes as a native binary and a Docker-based runtime which can be deployed to any server or cloud.

The framework provides powerful abstractions and building blocks to develop flexible, scalable JSON Rest backends:

* **Daptin database** to easily evolves your data schema & migrates your database \[Postgres/MySQL/SQLite\]
* **Flexible auth** using the JWT-based authentication & permission system
* **Realtime API** using Websocket subscriptions
* **Works with all frontend frameworks** like React, Vue.js, Angular (Quickstart Examples)
