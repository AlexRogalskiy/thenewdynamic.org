Your environment will have everything you need to build a modern static website:

* A Static Site Generator (Jekyll or Hugo)
* Language extras beyond ES6, like object spread operator.
* Autoprefixed CSS
* Hassle-free updates for the above tools with a single dependency.

The tradeoff is thatÂ **these tools are preconfigured to work in a specific way**. If your project needs more customization, you can "eject" and customize it, but then you will need to maintain this configuration.
