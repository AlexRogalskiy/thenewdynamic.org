DatoCMS is a fully customizable administrative area for your static websites. Use your favorite website generator, let your clients publish new content independently, host the site anywhere you like.

> **Which features were the most important for your agency?**
>
> Agency clients are often demanding and if something can be asked for, it will. So we needed flexibility, sure, but we also needed really good control over validation. A lot of CMSs are not built to be put in the hands of non-technical clients for extended periods of time, so you'll watch a site crumble as a result of clients slowly breaking all the rules, like uploading a 10 MB image or pasting three paragraphs of text in a headline. We took great pride in building high quality software that would last, so we couldn't let this happen.
>
> **Then you adopted DatoCMSâ€¦**
>
> Yes, we ended up finding a really good balance in Dato. It has a lot of flexibility, a good pricing range that accommodates both large and small projects, a great user experience even with deeply linked records, and a very thorough API.
