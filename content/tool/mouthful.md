Mouthful is a small but powerful commenting engine. Intended to be used as a self hosted alternative to disqus. Itâ€™s ad free. It supports markdown. It uses sqlite as the main database engine with dynamodb, mysql and postgres support. Written in GO and preact it comes with moderation support as well as an admin panel. The client is lightweight(\~14KB gzipped).
