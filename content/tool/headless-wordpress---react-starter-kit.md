Postlight's Headless WordPress + React Starter Kit is an automated toolset that will spin up two things:

1. A WordPress backend that serves its data via the [WP REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/).
2. A server-side rendered React frontend using [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/).

This starter kit spins up a WordPress backend with a React frontend talking to the WP REST API in two steps. To use it, clone the repository, and check out the README. The first command installs and starts WordPress on your computer, and the second starts a process that serves a React frontend. From there, you’re ready to start importing data from your own WordPress site, and customizing the backend and frontend for your own needs.
