Netlify Identity service brings a full suite of authentication functionality, backed by the [GoTrue API](https://www.gotrueapi.org/). This allows you to manage and authenticate users on your site or app, without requiring them to be users of Netlify or any other service. You can use this for [gated content](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2018/01/23/getting-started-with-jwt-and-identity/), site administration, and more.
