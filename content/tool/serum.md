A simple extension to make link-blogging to a Github-hosted Jekyll blog easy.

Install it from the Chrome WebStore

Just select the text you want to quote, click the toolbar button and make any necessary tweaks to the post and the new post file is added to the _drafts directory of your Jekyll blog on Github.
