React is used to generate pages for both client and server; it's called Isomorphic Universal rendering.

A pre-rendered, static version of your website is generated first; then when a user browses your website, they can get the same UX as an app by grabbing the minimal amount of data for each new page (a single file that only contains your page data).

For an extended introduction video, see this [video by Maxime Thirouin at the AtTheFrontend conference ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWPkj72Nn6s).
