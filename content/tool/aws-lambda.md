Like Google Cloud functions, AWS Lambda allows you to run your code in the cloud and only charge you when your code is running. Your can run 1M requests per month on the free tier.

If you're hosted on Netlify, [Netlify functions](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions/) allows you to easily add lambda functions that will run on AWS Lambda.
