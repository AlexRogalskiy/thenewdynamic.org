Nuxt.js is a framework for creating Universal Vue.js Applications.

Its main scope is UI rendering while abstracting away the client/server distribution.

Our goal is to create a framework flexible enough so that you can use it as a main project base or in addition to your current project based on Node.js.

Nuxt.js presets all the configuration needed to make your development of a Vue.js Application Server Rendered more enjoyable.

In addition, we also provide another deployment option called: nuxt generate. It will build a Static Generated Vue.js Application. We believe that option could be the next big step in the development of Web Applications with microservices.

As a framework, Nuxt.js comes with a lot of features to help you in your development between the client side and the server side such as Asynchronous Data, Middleware, Layouts, etc.
