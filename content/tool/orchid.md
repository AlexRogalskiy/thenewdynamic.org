Orchid is a static site generator capable of generating sites with hundreds or thousands of pages in seconds without even breaking a sweat. In addition, Orchid has many novel ways to configure large groups of pages from one central location, so you are never locked into a single theme or configuration, no matter how large your site is. With performance that rivals the best tools on the market and flexibility that simply cannot be matched by anything else out there, Orchid will not only replace your current static site generator, but do it better and faster, while being an absolute joy to work with.

With one click, you can get Orchid deployed to Netlify, complete with the Netlify CMS already configured. Plus, the NetlifyCMS automatically adapts to your Orchid plugins and configurations, all you have to do is write.
