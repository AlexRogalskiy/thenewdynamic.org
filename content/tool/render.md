Render is a modern cloud provider that makes it trivial and instant to deploy your code in production. You can deploy anything on Render, from simple static sites and cron jobs to databases and Dockerized private services.

Render deploys your services directly from GitHub. All that's needed is to push your code like you normally do â€” Render automatically updates your services and keeps them up and running at all times.
