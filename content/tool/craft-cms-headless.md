### Built-in GraphQL API

Craft features a built-in [GraphQL API](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/graphql.html) for your content. You can even define what’s available publicly versus what should be protected behind a private token.

### JSON API

The first party [Element API](https://plugins.craftcms.com/element-api) plugin can be used to create custom JSON API endpoints, including [JSON feeds](https://jsonfeed.org/).

### Headless Mode

If your Craft installation is completely decoupled from the front-end, you can enable [Headless Mode](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/config/config-settings.html#headlessmode) to hide all the cruft that you’re not going to need.
