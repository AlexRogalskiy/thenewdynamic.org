The post scheduler is a serverless project that gives static site owners the ability to schedule posts (or other site content).

It works with any static site setup (Jekyll, Hugo, Phenomic, Gatsby etc.)

See blog post for more information: ["How to schedule posts for static site generators (Jekyll, Hugo, Phenomic etc.)"](https://serverless.com/blog/static-site-post-scheduler/?utm_content=bufferf4214&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer)
