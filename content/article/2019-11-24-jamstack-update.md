The HTTP Archive's [Web Almanac](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/) is built upon the Archive's rich data set and a braintrust of 85 volunteer contributors. It's great nerdy reading, but I can't help concluding the web is not in great shape: Most sites are [_not_](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/page-weight) [fast](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/performance), or [secure](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/security), or [accessible](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/accessibility). And, of course, most sites—74%—are built with [Wordpress](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/cms), or other monolithic CMS-based systems.

> ...improvements in page weight have been more constrained by the low adoption of best practices than by the technology itself.

We know that monolithic systems are inherently slower than _our_ way, but I believe the problem is that people building websites often don't know or don't care to use best practices. We can do [better](https://reallyfastsites.com/site/eleventy)!

Moving along the [Technology Adoption Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_life_cycle), JAMstack made Thoughtworks' ["Annual Technology Radar"](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques?blipid=201911110) in the "worth exploring" category. [Forrester](https://go.forrester.com/blogs/does-unicorn-level-funding-signal-the-new-era-of-cms-has-arrived/) is already expecting a shakeout in the SaaS-based CMS market, and Dean Barker, author of "Web Content Management" [predicts](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/notes/38/):

> ...there's a shakeout coming for the headless market, in particular. Some vendor will start rolling up smaller players, and others will just cease operations.
