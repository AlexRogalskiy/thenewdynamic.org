This week began with the unexpected horror: An outage on JAMstack sites! Netlify sites were down for the better part of the morning and afternoon on Monday. This was a big deal because I don't remember it happening before. I mean _This is what we talk about when we talk about JAMstack!_

I had one client—just before we built him a JAMstack site last year—spend the better part of a weekend scrambling to add servers to his Wordpress site because it crashed just when (and because) he was getting a lot of traffic. He was very relieved to get away from all that. Server downtime is not a place I want to revisit, yet here I was on Monday faced with explaining to clients why the sites that were never supposed to go down were down.

Fortunately I had data on my side. I was able to show our clients through our Pingdom monitoring tool that they actually had 99.99% uptime and a 256 millisecond average response time. I got to talk about just why our sites were typically so stable and talk about [DDoS attacks](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/) and how web hosts are typically able to mitigate those attacks. At the Cloudflare Connect conference this week I learned just how hostile the internet is with billions of attacks per day, and felt relieved that we are already in the best possible position for having a stable platform.

So what started as a "Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day" ended up as an opportunity to learn and talk about why we use JAMstack in the first place.
