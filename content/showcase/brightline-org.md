The goal of this TED Women 2017, held in New Orleans, was to surface bold ideas from women and those who support them. We heard from an entrepreneur with an idea poised to transform how we consume power and from an architect who sees her work as being a healer. In this report, you can read these and others TEDWomen 2017 event's takeaways.
