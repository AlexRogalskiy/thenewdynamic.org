Datica.com is built with Middleman using Slim templates, vanilla JS, Hubspot integration for forms and CRM, and Zurb Foundation for the base styles. Contentful drives most of the larger sections and metadata, and we use Slim for the custom pages. Netlify builds and deploys them automatically. Itâ€™s been heavily optimized for performance, leveraging preload hints, lots of super-lean SVG work, and lazy-loading of images.
