The website was created to simplify and improve the interaction between the italian developers and the Public Administration, starting from some important projects like the National Registry of the Resident Population, or the digital management system of the public identity. Until now except some rare exceptions the central Public Administration limited itself on drawfting laws and regulations in a non-technical bureaucratic language without any tool or initiatives to support the developers involved in build and integrate software. Developers Italia wants to fill this gap starting from an handful of projects which will grow in the future.
