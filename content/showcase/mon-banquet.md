[Monbanquet](https://monbanquet.fr/) is a french startup who offers artisanal catering, companies can browse the different formulas and ask for an invoice.

The current version was migrated from Angular to Gatsby, for performance reasons by a single front-end developer in less than two months, withtout prior knowledge of the JAMstack.

All the content is now handled by the Marketing team in Contentful .

The site is hosted on Netlify. 

As the company doesn't hit the free tiers, infrastructure and SaaS don't cost _anything_ at the moment.

Next step will be to add user authentification and e-commerce capabilities.
