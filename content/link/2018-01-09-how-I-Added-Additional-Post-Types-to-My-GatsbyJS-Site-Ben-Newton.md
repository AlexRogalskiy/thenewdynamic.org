First things first, I needed to add the source for my new posts. The starter is already pulling data from markdown files in /content/posts utilizing gatsby-source-filesystem. I thought I could just add another reference to markdown files in a new directory and Iâ€™d reference that in a separate GraphQL query and have a separate array of posts to work with, but that is not how it works.
