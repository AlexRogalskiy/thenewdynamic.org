In short, the GitLab CI is a set of commands that can be run when a repository receives a push, when an API is called, or when it is triggered by someone through the GUI. The commands are specified in a given YAML formatted configuration file - .gitlab-cy.yml which contains a set of specific keywords and arguments.
