Directus is a “headless” CMS & API that decouples your content so it can be connected anywhere and everywhere. With a highly extensible DBaaS core elegantly wrapped with an intuitive admin web-application, Directus can mirror even the most complex database architectures. Best of all, this premium framework is completely free and open-source.
