A week ago, I presented a CloudFormation template for an AWS Git-backed Static Website stack. If you are not familiar with it, please review the features of this complete Git + static website CloudFormation stack. This weekend, I extended the stack to support a plugin architecture to run the static site generator of your choosing against your CodeCommit Git repository content.
