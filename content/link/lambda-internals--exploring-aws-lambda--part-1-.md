[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) is an excellent environment for rapid and scalable development. As a developer, I love using it. The main advantage of Lambda is that you can focus solely on your code. No more thinking about web-servers, machines, scalability and other issues for which you REALLY don’t care. Upload your code, say the magic words (aka serverless invoke) and your code is executed.
