 If you’re new to Hugo, one of the things you learn pretty quickly is that unlike Jekyll, and some other popular static site generators, there’s no plugin system to extend beyond the core task of combining Markdown and templates to output a set of static .html files. For example, there’s no equivalent to jekyll-assets to compile Sass, concat JavaScripts, etc. Fortunately the npm ecosystem already has great tools for performing these tasks, it just means your build system needs to take a “best of breed” approach that combines the awesome HTML generation powers of Hugo with other tools to do the rest.
