As a content repository, Kentico Cloud offers unlimited possibilities for delivering content to any device, displayed in any format. When it comes to websites, a common use case is to use ASP.NET or .NET Core to create web pages driven by the content from Kentico Cloud. This brings the overheads of .NET development, hosting solutions (primarily Azure), and other requirements to get a website up and running.
