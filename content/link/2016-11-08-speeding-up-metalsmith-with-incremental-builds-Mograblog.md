I love metalsmith. Since I transitioned to it I write more on my blog. The only thing that annoyed me is that it became a bit slow. I found myself waiting several seconds between changes. So yesterday I decided to do something about it and I reached to a 500ms build on change. I'd like to share with you what I did.
