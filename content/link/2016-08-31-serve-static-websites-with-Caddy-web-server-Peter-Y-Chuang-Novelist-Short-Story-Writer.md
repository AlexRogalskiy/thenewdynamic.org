Initially, I put this website on Github Pages, which is free and fast, but lacks flexibility. For months, I’ve been itching to migrate (the move to Firebase proved short-lived) while dreading the prospect of having to configure and maintain a server. Then I discovered Caddy web server, the easiest-to-set-up web server I’ve ever used.
