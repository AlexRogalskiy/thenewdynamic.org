Github Pages is a really nice (free) service for hosting static HTML websites. You can push simple HTML files, but you can also push a Jekyll site and Github will build it. This site is built with Jekyll and hosted on Github Pages, and I use it for all of my code projects too.
 
The Jekyll setup for Github pages is a little weird, and there are a lot of gotchas to making it run correctly.
