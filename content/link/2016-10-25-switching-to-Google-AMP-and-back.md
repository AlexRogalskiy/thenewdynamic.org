This website is built with Jekyll, hosted on Github pages, and behind a Cloudflare proxy. Why cloudflare? Same reason for using AMP! Websites are pretty much my business, and I want my own home to be powered by both TLS and HTTP/2!

What this meant for AMP though is that I had to change my main site into an AMP site. Dynamic websites unlike this might be able to create both an AMP and non-AMP website.
