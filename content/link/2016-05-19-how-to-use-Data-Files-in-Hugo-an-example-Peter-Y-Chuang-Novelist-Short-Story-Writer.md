In Hugo, Data Files are placed inside the data folder. Inside, you can further organise the files into different levels of sub-folders. For example, I have a folder named novelists, and inside novelists I have one more level of sub-folders, in which I store my data in YAML (you can choose to use TOML and JSON).
