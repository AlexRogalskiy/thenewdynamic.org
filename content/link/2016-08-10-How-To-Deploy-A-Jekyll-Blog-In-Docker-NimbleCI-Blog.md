The biggest advantage of using Jekyll is that we can put our blog posts in a GIT repo. This means that all changes to the posts will be recorded and we donâ€™t have to worry about backups when the site is live, since we can regenerate the entire site at any moment from the source code in the GIT repo. Also, it gives us complete portability, it will be easy to move the posts to another blogging platform if needed since we have all of the posts in markdown in the GIT repo.
