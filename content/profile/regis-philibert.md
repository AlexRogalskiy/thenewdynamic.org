description: "I build websites from and occasionally for Montréal \U0001F1E8\U0001F1E6.\n\nI
  am front end first and foremost, the view is what I love best. That being said being
  both a Wordpress' old-timer and a Hugo proselyte, if your backend leans on those,
  I'm here for you.\n\nDuring slower weeks I enjoy writing about my work on my \\[blog\\]([https://regisphilibert.com/blog](https://regisphilibert.com/blog
  \"https://regisphilibert.com/blog\")) and learning new things!"
