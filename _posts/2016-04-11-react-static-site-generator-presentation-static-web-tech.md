> React.js is surging in popularity as a modern build tool, and web developers are flocking to it to build sites and web apps.

> Kyle Mathews is the creator of Gatsby, a React.js-based static site generator. He’s also the co-founder of RelateRocket.

> We’re bringing Kyle in to talk to you about building with React, the process of creating a static site builder, and why pairing the modern stack with git is increasingly the workflow of choice for frontend web devs.
