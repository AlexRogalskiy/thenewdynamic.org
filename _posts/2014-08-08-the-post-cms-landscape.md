In [_The No-db Landscape_](/tools/the-no-db-landscape/) I layed out the differences between "flat-file" CMSs and static site generators. Today we'll have a look at the "Post-CMS" CMS and some new developments in the field.

What does "post-CMS" mean anyway? I didn't [make up](http://developmentseed.org/blog/2012/07/27/build-cms-free-websites/) the [phrase](http://ben.balter.com/2012/10/01/welcome-to-the-post-cms-world/), but to my mind the post-CMS world is one where the tools we use to build a website are composed of whatever suits the job as opposed to being dictated by a CMS that typically constitutes an entire way of being and comes packaged with lots of middleware you my never use. The "post-CMS" approach is lightweight, minimalistic and goes hand-in-hand with the static site renaissance. 

One of the best exemplars of this approach is the static site generator [Metalsmith.io](http://www.metalsmith.io/). Just launched in March of this year, Metalsmith, built on node.js, is as sophisticated as it is simple, owing to its "everything is a plugin" philosophy.
