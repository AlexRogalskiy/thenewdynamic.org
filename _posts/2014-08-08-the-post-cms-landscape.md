In [_The No-db Landscape_](/tools/the-no-db-landscape/) I wrote about the differences between "flat-file" CMSs and static site generators. Today we'll have a look at the "Post-CMS" CMS and some new developments.

While I didn't [make up](http://ben.balter.com/2012/10/01/welcome-to-the-post-cms-world/), the term ["Post CMS,"](http://developmentseed.org/blog/2012/07/27/build-cms-free-websites/) the idea has resonated with me enough to devote part of this site to the idea. Statically generated sites, by the way, are but a subset of the post-CMS paradigm and actually the most minimal manifestation; really the opposite, in most cases, of a CMS.

To my mind, "post-CMS" means the disaggregation and, in many cases, elimination of the component parts of a CMS. So a post-cms may have a database, and it may have an editor and many other facets of a CMS, but each of those tools is most likely to come 




is one where the tools we use to build a website are composed of whatever suits the job as opposed to being dictated by a CMS that typically constitutes an entire way of being and comes packaged with lots of middleware you may never use. The "post-CMS" approach is lightweight, minimalistic and goes hand-in-hand with the static site renaissance.


One of the best exemplars of this approach is the static site generator [Metalsmith.io](http://www.metalsmith.io/). Just launched in March of this year, Metalsmith, built on node.js, is as sophisticated as it is simple, owing to its "everything is a plugin" philosophy. The Metalsmith site provides some examples of how you might use it, like ebook generator and build tool, and its creator Ian Storm Taylor nicely laid out his use own cases on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7363734) to demonstrate their thinking.
