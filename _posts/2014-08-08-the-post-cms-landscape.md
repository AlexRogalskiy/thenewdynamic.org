In [_The No-db Landscape_](/tools/the-no-db-landscape/) I wrote about the differences between "flat-file" CMSs and static site generators. Today we'll have a look at the idea of a "Post-CMS" and some new developments.


While I didn't [make up](http://ben.balter.com/2012/10/01/welcome-to-the-post-cms-world/), the term ["Post CMS,"](http://developmentseed.org/blog/2012/07/27/build-cms-free-websites/) the idea should resonate with anyone who has devoted to installing, configuring, updating and coding in big content management systems. To my mind, "post-CMS" means the disaggregation and, in many cases, elimination of the component parts of a CMS. So a post-cms may or may not have a database of some sort, and it may have an editor and many other facets of a CMS, but each of those tools is not only entirely optional, but may very well come from different sources. They're _Ã¡la carte_ rather than _prix fixe_.

Statically generated sites are but a subset of the post-CMS paradigm and actually the most minimal manifestation; the opposite, in most cases, of a CMS. When we think of static site generators we think of content in markdown or text documents, or perhaps a JSON file or even a spreadsheet, which is then processed through templates with the result being an entire website generated at once. There are trade-offs to this approach and one of them is the lack, at the moment, of a truly competent web-based editor. 

Another recent trend: Entirely separating the function of content management from the function of displaying that content on a website. Stripping the "system" from content management, these tools are billed as "content management as a service" and are entirely focused on the content editing aspects of a website. In fact, none of the features of a content management system are present other than content management. Examples include [Osmek](http://osmek.com/), [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/), and [Prismic](https://prismic.io/). [Webhook](http://www.webhook.com/) is a closely related example, though it's a fully blown system; I mention it because it's the only one that is open source (Webhook is a service and the underlying software is being open sourced) and it is also a static site generator.

One of the best features of these systems is that you can use your content on as many sites as you like; it's all available via an API to deploy with, typically, a variety of programming languages. One question remains in my mind is how easy it would be to move content from on system to another, if a provider went out of business, changed their service or pricing, or your needs changed. 













One of the best exemplars of this approach is the static site generator [Metalsmith.io](http://www.metalsmith.io/). Just launched in March of this year, Metalsmith, built on node.js, is as sophisticated as it is simple, owing to its "everything is a plugin" philosophy. The Metalsmith site provides some examples of how you might use it, like ebook generator and build tool, and its creator Ian Storm Taylor nicely laid out his use own cases on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7363734) to demonstrate their thinking.
