"What is the Best Static Site Generator?" Someone asked this on Twitter recently and shortely thereafter Mashable published a decidedly unjournalistic list called "[13 Static Site Generators to Help You Build Your Ultimate Website](http://mashable.com/2014/08/28/static-website-generators/)," which at least is a sign that static sites are coming into the mainstream. 

The problem is that choosing a static site generator is something like choosing a stereo (do people still buy stereos?) where preferences and budget are driving factors. Preferences here might be programming or template language you are comfortable with, or the degree of "opinionatedness" you want.
