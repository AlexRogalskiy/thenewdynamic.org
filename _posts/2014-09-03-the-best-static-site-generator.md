"What is the Best Static Site Generator?" Someone asked this on Twitter recently and shortly thereafter Mashable published a decidedly unjournalistic list called "[13 Static Site Generators to Help You Build Your Ultimate Website](http://mashable.com/2014/08/28/static-website-generators/)," which at least is a sign that static sites are coming into the mainstream. 

The problem is that choosing a static site generator is something like choosing a stereo (do people still buy stereos?) where preferences and budget are driving factors, rather than a singular best. Preferences here might be programming or template language you are comfortable with, or the degree of "opinionatedness" you want and budget is your level of expertise.
