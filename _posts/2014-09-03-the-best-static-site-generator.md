I'm not even going to try to answer that question, but maybe I can give some context around why you might choose a particular application for your needs. 

I think many people choose on language (i.e. Ruby, Node.js), so for that there are a lot of lists:

- [The updated big list of static website generators for your site, blog or wiki](http://blog.iwantmyname.com/2014/05/the-updated-big-list-of-static-website-generators-for-your-site-blog-or-wiki.html)
- [Static Site Generators](http://staticsitegenerators.net/)
- [StaticGen](http://www.staticgen.com/)

One great thing about static site generators is that they're developer tools, not something you have to convince a client about, no more than a designer might have to convince a client to use Sketch instead of Photoshop. It's also pretty easy to move your content between one app or another to try them out, or even pull down a copy and try with sample content. 

Here are some of the factors I think are important.

- Language (in terms of familiarity or preference): The language the app was built in is important, but for a lot of people, the available templating language or languages is most important for building sites. 

- Documentation







Preferences and budget are driving factors, rather than a singular best. Preferences here might be programming or template language you are comfortable with, or the degree of "opinionatedness" you want and budget is your level of expertise.

easy to use

Jekyll's Liquid template engine and configuration options makes it easy to use, but installing Ruby on your machine is a prerequsuite and causes [headaches](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/search?q=installing&type=Issues&utf8=%E2%9C%93) for some.
