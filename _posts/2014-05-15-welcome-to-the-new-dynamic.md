I've built hundreds of websites over the past dozen years from super simple to the complex. As a long-time user and observer of web publishing technology, and you could say at times a partisan in the CMS wars, I've never been as excited as I am about static site generators and the "Post-CMS world". Why?

Performance, simplicity, flexibility, and cost.

I'll go into these in more detail in subsequent posts. I created {static is} The New Dynamic for the very selfish reason that the more web professionals understand and adopt dynamic sites the better the software and practices will be. I intend to take a fairly high-level approach with this site and post about developments in the static site generator landscape and great sites built statically.
