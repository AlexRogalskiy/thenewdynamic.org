#### Joint Meetup! "static is the New Dynamic" with the "NY Web Performance" Meetup.

We'll be hosted by Workmarket who will be providing free pizza and beer! This talk centers around making static sites work in the real world; from editing content (for non-technical users), to building and staging sites, to deployment and hosting, as well as user interaction. We'll review the landscape of tools and real-world use-cases.

For newcomers to the world of static we'll start with a brief introduction and some points of reference. We'll be joined by Jeremia Kimelman of the U.S. General Services Administration's 18F group [https://18f.gsa.gov/] to talk about why and how they're enabling government agencies to publish static websites using existing tools along with a demo of their new open source "Federalist" platform.
