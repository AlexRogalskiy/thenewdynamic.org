We're pretty excited to announce that our next Meetup will be held in conjunction with our sponsor O'Reilly at their Velocity Conference!

Our first speaker will be Chris Macrae who is coming from Canada to speak about "Git-based or API-driven CMSs.’

In “Git-based or API-driven CMS” Chris Macrae breaks down the differences between the two different types of Headless CMS’ — Git-based and API-driven CMS’ — helping you decide on the right tools for your next web project. He explores the difference between static and dynamic sites, when you should choose static or dynamic, and explains which type of CMS’ is better suited for these jobs.

We will also review the JAMStack landscape to look at the ever expanding tools and services out there to build better faster websites.

We will have limited space.

Thanks!

Bud
