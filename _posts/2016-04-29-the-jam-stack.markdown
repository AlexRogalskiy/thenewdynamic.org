[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) CEO Mathias Biilmann (_this site is hosted with Netlify_) gave a talk at [Smashing Conference](http://smashingconf.com/sf-2016/speakers/mathias-biilman) in San Francisco last week. It's is a great discussion of need for and growth of the static web stack, which he describes, compellingly, as the "Jam Stack," starting with a git-based workflow.


JAM Philosophy

- Decouple Building and Hosting
- Decouple Front-end and Back-end
- APIs rather than databases
- Pre-baked Markup, enhanced with JS
