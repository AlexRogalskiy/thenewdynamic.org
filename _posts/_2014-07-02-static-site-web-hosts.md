One of the great attributes of static sites is that they can be hosted on _any_ server. If thrown my build folder up on a server in a pinch and had a fully functioning website without a thought to server configuration. However, there are some considerations to think about to get the best performance and ease of use:

- Ease of deployment
- Optimization: Handling of cached resources, use of CDN
- SSL support, if needed
- cost
