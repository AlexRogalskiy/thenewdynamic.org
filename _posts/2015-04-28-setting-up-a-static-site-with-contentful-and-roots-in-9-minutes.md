The two biggest pain points for adopting static sites are editing content, and deployment. I've been amazed at the great solutions coming online that I think will bring static sites truly into the mainstream.

If you've heard me talk about this, you'll recall that I think completely separating your content (and editing that content) is the best solution for content management today's multi-use world. 

Here's the video from a recent webinar I attended from [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com) and [Carrot](http://carrot.is/)—who make the [Roots](http://roots.cx/) static site generator—both of whom I've mentioned on the site before. This is a tutorial on creating a static site quickly with Contentful and Roots software, and deploying with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Also see the blog post over at [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/blog/2015/04/28/webinar-contentful-roots-static-sites/) with an overview.
