Aside from the technological baggage inherent in most CMSs, practical usage of these systems can be sclerotic. Think about what you might do to migrate from one CMS to another: You would 1) start by setting up a server and database, 2) configuring and installing the software, 3) applying your data model to the new CMS (i.e. set up fields etc), 4) figuring out the database scheme or find a plugin to help with the import and then spend hours if not days trying to get the import right, and 5) template the new site. By the time you get to the critical points of 3 and 5 you've invested a great deal of time.

Contrast this with the typical static site generator, you'd 1) install the software and any dependencies (typically this takes inside of 60 seconds), 2) dump your content in a folder, and 3) start templating. The entire process is a matter of minutes, not hours or days. My example is simplistic, but I've done this. I've taken content in bunch of text files and have freely moved them from one application to the next to find the best fit. In this world you are rewarded for experimentation.
