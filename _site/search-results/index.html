[_n.b. in an early stage of development_]---#### From an interview with Gatsby's creator, Kyle Matthews at [Aerobatic.com](https://www.aerobatic.com/blog/gatsbyjs)**Why Gatsby? The Advantage of React Over Templates**The current crop of content management systems (CMS) utilizes templates to organize content. Things like Liquid Jekyll, S/Twig, etc. While these work, there is now a better approach — components. The leading web component framework is, of course, ReactJS. See what the React team says themselves about the advantages of components are over templates:&gt; Traditionally, web application UIs are built using templates or HTML directives. These templates dictate the full set of abstractions that you are allowed to use to build your UI. React [and Gatsby] approaches building user interfaces differently by breaking them into components. This means React uses a real, full featured programming language (JavaScript) to render views, which we see as an advantage over templates for a few reasons:&gt; By unifying your markup with its corresponding view logic, React [and thus Gatsby] can actually make views easier to extend and maintain.**Why GatsbyJS was created**I asked Kyle Mathews why he created GatsbyJS, and why he thinks React components are better:&gt; Four main reasons. React components are perfect if you want a “progressive” website as it’s trivial to layer in javascript-driven experiences on top of the static HTML version.&gt; Second, React components are highly reusable/sharable. There’s a huge number of fantastic React components already available on NPM (see..."

However, as the content continued to grow we realized that due to our product release cycle WordPress was no longer the right tool to maintain such as a vast library of tutorials as it was not scalable. That's when we started our quest. Things fell into place as technologies such as Jekyll, Git and Markdown were combined together, providing us with a way to work more efficiently across the board:Jekyll was the right choice for us because it is well established and with an active community. Its toolset also fit us very nicely and it's fun to work with. Going static made things faster by working with files locally instead of with a database and made the website lighter.Tools we're using:- GitHub Enterprise- TravisCI- IBM Bluemix DevOps Services- Jekyll"

Most small publishers don't have the resources to maintain a new server-side application every time they want to publish a new book. And for us as a museum, the long-term availability of the content is an important concern. But the bar is set very high by the beautiful print books people are accustomed to, so delivering a poor experience in the name of long-term sustainability is not an option either.I think that's where tools like Middleman really shine. There is a master set of content files (Markdown and YAML docs) and then a series of different output formats are auto-generated as necessary. Write once, put it in version control, and publish anywhere – that's the dream, and I think it's becoming doable.Anyway, that's the underlying philosophy behind the project. It is 100% static – the &quot;database&quot; for catalogue entries is just a bunch of YAML files. Other static features include:* Client-side search (full-text) via [Lunr.js](http://lunrjs.com/).* [SmoothState](http://smoothstate.com/): These two actually work together; the full-text search index is too heavy to load each time the user navigates to a new page, so with SmoothState it is initialized once and then always ready. In some ways these performance gains were much more important than the transition effects, though the latter is why I first wanted to use it.* The catalogue page is actually a self-contained [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org/) component; Vue is a..."

It is not only available as a single, easy-to-install binary file for Mac, Linux and Windows, it was written to be insanely great in terms of speed and performance. Most sites build in milliseconds; in fact it takes longer to sync them to your web host than it does to generate the site! We like it so much that we built my personal site [Rick Cogley Central](http://rick.cogley.info/), eSolia's [English esolia.com](http://esolia.com/) and [Japanese esolia.co.jp](http://esolia.co.jp/) sites, and finally, eSolia's professional blog at [eSolia.pro](http://esolia.pro/) in it.

Basically the nesting of the files should result in the nesting of the URLs. But we also want to be able to tie in metadata that we have in our database about all of our integrations.

They’re unequivocally faster, simpler to maintain and build, and more secure and stable than database-driven websites. There are tradeoffs of course, but in my view well worth it. I don’t understand the talk I see about static sites being for “hackers” or small or simple sites. I’ve seen some large, complex and highly trafficked sites built this way. See my earlier post in this series for more information.For the most part I’ve been using two applications. For purely static sites I use Jekyll and for “flat-file” CMS sites I’ve used Statamic. Each is excellent in its own right, yet serves a different purpose than the other.This article is aimed squarely at the designer/developer building websites for clients. Choosing the right technology is an important part of a developer’s job so I’ll go into my thinking here about when I why I might choose either.So what is the difference between a “Flat File CMS” and a “Static Site Generator”?Both flat-file CMSs (or file-based CMSs) and statically generated websites have no database at all. That alone is significant. All of your site’s content is merely a collection of text files.This is what a document might look like in a flat-file site (or see this post as a raw text file):---title: Titlecategory: Categorylayout: articledate: November 10, 2013author: authorname---content goes hereGenerally speaking templates and layout schemes tend to be similar in both types..."

Jekyll 3.1 is a fast (significantly faster than 2.4) and capable beast, but as always, has its nuances, so I feel I need to spend some quality tinkering time with it.I had intended to host the site on S3 as I had originally done, provisioning my own “Let’s Encrypt” TSL certificate, but when it came down to it, Netlify is so fast and easy, not to mention their instant provisioning of “Let’s Encrypt,” that I couldn’t resist. And, the Netflify gang is an important part of the nascent static community, such as it is, so hosting there seems quite natural.As I’ve building up my collections on the site, I’ve set up defaults for managing the site’s content in CloudCannon’s editor, which is beautiful and capable. I use it for my clients, so, even though I do most of my work locally, I like having the ability to do so. Defaults are pretty easy to set up and have the added benefit of forcing you to standardize your fields a bit.I’ve also started using Imgix for provisioning images. It’s super nice being able to manipulate images on the fly and their CDN is fast and it’s quite easy to get up and running. Stay tuned for a post soon about getting up and running.ChangesJob BoardYou may notice a menu item for “Job Board.” I don’t know exactly what this will look like in the end, but I know there..."

It was a milestone in the movement for web developers to utilize a less bloated technology stack than had become the norm over the past decade3.Static site generators, like Jekyll, convert text documents into HTML using one or more templates for laying out the pages. There is no content management system and no database. While once the realm of “hackers” only, there’s a growing list use-cases for sites created this way because they’re incredibly fast, simple and flexible.The ProblemThe heart of a “traditional” CMS driven website is a SQL database where all the site’s content and settings are rigidly organized into tables with rows and columns, something like a very complicated spreadsheet. Each CMS has its own scheme of organizing this information and on top of the database there is an application layer that converts the data into pages, route those pages into web addresses to serve to end users, and manages various user functions, whether or not we need them.Querying the database every time a page loads takes time, which, even measured in milliseconds has shown to..."

When you change DNS settings at Cloudflare, the changes happen very quickly.I’m not entirely sure static sites’ performance benefit from Cloudflare’s network, particulalry if you’re already serving your assets from a CDN, but they offer an incredible number of features for performance, threat control, stats, caching and asset minification, and I think overall Cloudflare is particularly helpful for managing static sites.I’ve sometimes missed not having an htaccess file for setting up rules on sites I’m serving from Google Cloud, AWS, or Github Pages, but Cloudflare fills that gap. You can set rules (unfortunately only three for free accounts) for forwarding pages, and their “scrapesheild” service allows you to obfuscate email address, offers hotlink protection and server side excludes.One feature I’m looking forward to trying is their SSL service, which, at a very basic level, is offered for free. I’ve been using Cloudflare for quite a few years now and manage quite a few sites through them. The services they provide have grown significantly and their recent redesign has really helped make everything easy to use.p.s. If you use Cloudflare, be sure to enable Two-factor authentication in your account."

But there are plenty of use-cases for something like this where you need the interface for editing (or, perhaps, just have a lot of content in Wordpress), but want to take advantage of the flexibility and performance or scalability of a static site.

Today we’ll have a look at the idea of a “Post-CMS” and some new developments.I didn’t make up it up, but I love the idea of a “Post CMS” world and it should resonate with anyone who has devoted countless hours to installing, configuring, updating and coding big content management systems. To my mind, “post-CMS” means the disaggregation and, in many cases, elimination of the component parts of a CMS. What remains is simply the tools we need to for a particular project and nothing more.Is there such a thing as a Post-CMS CMS? Perhaps, but it doesn’t look much like what we’ve known in the past. A post-CMS CMS may or may not have a database of some sort, and it may have an editor and many other facets of a CMS, but it won’t have layers of pre-built software that comes with it. Each of those components is not only entirely optional, but may very well come from different sources. They’re ála carte rather than prix fixe; tapas rather than Beef Wellington!An exemplar of this approach is the static site generator Metalsmith.io. Just launched in March and already proving to be popular, Metalsmith, built on Node.js, is as sophisticated as it is simple, owing to its “everything is a plugin” philosophy.Statically generated sites are but a subset of the post-CMS paradigm and actually the most minimal manifestation; the opposite, in most cases,..."

Here’s the forward thinking Vox Media on their use of Middleman as part of their publishing strategy: In a nutshell, our Editorial Apps system consists of a static Middleman site, which is populated from one or more Google Spreadsheets at build time (using our middleman-google-drive extension, which we’ll talk about in a future article), and then deployed to Chorus by doing a git push and using git post-receive hooks, in a way not unlike deploying an app to Heroku.Read the rest at Vox Media’s Product blog.This is interesting for a lot of reasons. Vox is, aside even from their publishing efforts, is on the forefront of content management with their Chorus CMS, so I’m happy to hear that static sites fit into their vision. I’m also interested to hear that their using Google Spreadsheets for data. As easy as I find Markdown documents and YAML lists, not everyone feels comfortable with them and a spreadsheet is comfortable and certainly good for some data, and, of course, using Google Spreadsheets has the benefit of being great for collaboration.I’ve seen others use this approach. Jim Pravetz used GS for an online shop and wrote about it on his blog (“Generating Jekyll Pages From Data”), though I believe he’s now using Shopify for that site now. Coderwall has a brief tutorial on “Use a Google Spreadsheet as your JSON backend” too.Vox has made the source code for the Verge-50..."

      "content": "With the addition of collections in Jekyll 2.0 there are a lot of choices one can make about how to structure their site. Besides collections, now you can also add JSON files to the _data directory. I put together this decision tree to help anyone who needs it. This, of course, reflects my own way of thinking about content in a static site generator context, specifically applied to Jekyll. One thing I love about not using a database is that your content is much closer to its original form: documents are documents, data is data. Note that this variety may very well change in the future as collections pages and posts converge toward one content type, likely to be collections with optional features of posts, I’m guessing."

What is the real effort in developing, hosting and maintaining sites which have many moving parts? The cost of serving static sites has never been lower. And front-end development practices have never been richer. Couldn’t we harness this better and make life simpler without dumbing down?  In this talk we’ll explore some unexpected capabilities and characteristics of “static” sites. We’ll look at ways to use emerging tools and services to create robust, high performance websites which can be more dynamic than some of their heavier and more costly brothers and sisters.more at Smashing ConferenceAlso see a video of Phil’s talk at Generate London in this post: “Generate London: Break through the limits of static site generators”"

This can be quite long, in fact.HTML OUTNow, imagine a folder of these markdown files on your hard drive. We’ll call this your project. The code of our static site generator could say “for each markdown file in folder x, move it to folder y.” But that’s not too exciting.Let’s say, instead of just moving that file, the generator reads all the files in a certain directory or directories and creates an “object” with them: “For each file in folder x, list its contents in our object.” That object is just a stored list of all the files, including their file names, any meta-data specified in the front matter, and their content.That object might look something like this (in Ruby, as output from Jeyll):{“layout”=&amp;gt;”default”, “title”=&amp;gt;”The Title of an Entry Here”, “category”=&amp;gt;”News”, “excerpt”=&amp;gt;”A short excerpt here”, “published”=&amp;gt;true, “url”=&amp;gt;”/news/2015/04/14/post-title-here/”, “dir”=&amp;gt;”/news/2015/04/14”, “date”=&amp;gt;2015-04-14 00:00:00 -0400, “id”=&amp;gt;”/news/2015/04/14/post-title-here”, “categories”=&amp;gt;[“news”], “next”=&amp;gt;, “previous”=&amp;gt;, “tags”=&amp;gt;[], “path”=&amp;gt;”_posts/2015-04-14-post-title-here.md”, “content”=&amp;gt;”Some markdown content here, which is likely the longest part.

As he points out, quite a few static websites would easily fit within the free level, which allows for 10,000 records (entries/assets), and 50,000 api calls. You also don’t jump immediately to the higher level, as there are paid upgrades that seem to be reasonable.Still, this brings home, in my view, the biggest problem with CMaaS products. It’s not so much the pricing, but vendor lock-in. At the point you go from 0, or some low-level, to 249, you’re captive and have to make a decision about staying with the product. Steve also looks at Cockpit, a PHP-based API-driven CMS, which I’ve evaluated before..."
