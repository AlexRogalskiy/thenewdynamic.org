I recently moved my blog from Medium to static generation with Hugo & hosting with Netlify. I prefer static hosting for performance reasons, and because Markdown is so nice.

This approach is good for people who are comfortable with Git and other dev tools. It’s not great if you like UI’s that (say) Medium or Wordpress provides.
