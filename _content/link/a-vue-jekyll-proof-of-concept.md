I’ve been continuing to play around with an isomorphic(ish) approach to building sites with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). In my [last post](https://distresssignal.org/vue-routing-with-jekyll), I looked at routing, navigation, and the history API. This time I look at sharing data, templating, and bringing it all together. Believing that the best way to “learn a thing”, is to just “build a thing”—I wen’t ahead and built out a [little example application](https://culture-namer.surge.sh/) that brings all this stuff together in a single working site.
