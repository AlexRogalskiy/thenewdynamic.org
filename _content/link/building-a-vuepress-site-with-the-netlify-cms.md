In this tutorial, I will show you how to build a static site with VuePress and the Netlify CMS. If you are not familiar with VuePress, it's a static site generator built on top of Vue by Evan You (founder of Vue). Unlike Nuxt.js, the primary focus for VuePress is to build static sites with a fairly opinionated structure which takes care of a lot of the setup work. Netlify, a modern platform for static sites, has a CMS to manage static sites which makes it easy for anyone to manage the content via an editor.
