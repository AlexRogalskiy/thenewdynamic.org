We had a great first [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/The-New-Dynamic/events/222477212/) on June 10th, 2015. I gave a presentation on my history with static sites, why I use them, and some use-cases and examples.

The video is a bit screwed up. We lost it twenty minutes in to the talk and picked up for another 15-20 minutes sometime after. And my head is chopped off in parts.
