Steve Schofield has been exploring various content management concepts, including Content Management as a Service (CMaaS), and API-driven strategies at the Beach blog, "The Guild." Beach is the maker of the desktop static site generator app,&nbsp;[Hammer for Mac](http://hammerformac.com/), and the [Forge](https://getforge.com/) static hosting service.

Quoting Christian Owens, CEO at Paddle on using Contentful with the Hammer app, he writes:

> My favourite thing about this is that prior to using contentful our two options were:
>
> - install wordpress and build something.
>
> - manage the whole thing statically with markdown files and forego some functionality.
>
> the other option was to build some kind of docs CMS from scratch, but who has time for that!

Steve also says that the biggest feedback about Contentful has been about pricing, which, despite having a generous free level, ramps up from their to $249 per month (when the post was written, Contentful had a slightly different pricing structure)
