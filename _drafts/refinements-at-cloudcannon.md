Over the past year we've seen the rise of the missing link in static tech: the content editor. I think this is important development for two reasons: First, as everyone acknowledges, it's quite difficult to get non-technical people to update a site without a WYSIWYG interface.

Secondly, and a bit under the radar, is the importance of editors in managing large data sets; specifically, creating the relationships between data, which is crucial to full-fledged content strategy.&nbsp;

To that last point, [Cloudcannon](http://cloudcannon.com/), the most refined of the editors out there, has changed the interface for selecting multiple related items.&nbsp;
