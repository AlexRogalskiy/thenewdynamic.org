Helpful Videos for Getting Started with Jekyll

When I started learning Jekyll I found [Thomas Bradley's series of videos](%5Bhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWjCJDeWfDdfVEcLGAfdJn%5C_HXyM4Y7%5C_k-%5D) helpful. I also deconstructed some of Michael Rose's [themes](https://mademistakes.com/work/jekyll-themes/) and generally tried to push the Liquid templating language as far as I could.

The guys at [Cloudcanon](http://cloudcannon.com/) (the "CMS for Jekyll") have created an entire site of jekyll tips, tutorials and code, now including a series of videos. The first videos cover the topics of "Collections" and "Front Matter." View them here: [http://jekyll.tips/jekyll-casts/](http://jekyll.tips/jekyll-casts/)
